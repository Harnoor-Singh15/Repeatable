ðŸ“Œ Description
In many real-world scenarios, users often find themselves repeatedly copying and pasting the same text multiple times â€” whether for software testing, formatting templates, automation, or rapid message generation. Manually doing this process is not only repetitive but also inefficient.

To address this, I developed a Text Repeater Tool â€” a simple yet effective Python-based solution that takes user input for a custom message and the number of repetitions required. With just two inputs, the tool automatically generates the repeated output, line by line, saving both time and manual effort.

âœ… Features

Accepts a number to define how many times the text should be repeated

Auto-generates line-by-line repeated output

Clean and easy-to-understand logic â€” ideal for beginners to learn about string manipulation and input handling

ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases
Automating repetitive tasks

Generating bulk placeholder text

Simulating inputs for testing
